# Deep-Learning-in-Python

Data From https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews.

Using deep learning(Support Vector Machine, Neural Network) to predict review score bease on reviewer's description.

After running the code, the Neural Network model seems to have outperform the SVM as the prediction error in SVM is about 50% more than Neural Network.

WineReview data cleaning 1.0.ipynb is to clean up and prepare the data for machine learning.
